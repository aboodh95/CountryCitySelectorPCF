# CountryCitySelectorPCF
a PCF will allow the user to select the country from drop down instead of writing them to avoid typo

- Just added to the form and bound it to Country & City fields
- In order to use it in the OOB entities with field type address follow the instructions from this link <a href="https://www.magnetismsolutions.com/blog/jaredjohnson/2019/07/04/binding-to-address-fields-in-a-pcf-control">Binding to address fields in a pcf control</a>
